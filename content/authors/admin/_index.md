I am a Wallenberg Initiative on Networks and Quantum information (WINQ) Fellow at Nordita, hosted by Stockholm University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology. My research involves various aspects of network science, including dynamics and optimisation, the incorporation of negative signs (e.g. friend-foe relationships), and community detection. 

I received my PhD from University of Oxford, where I was very fortunate to be supervised by [Renaud Lambiotte](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/renaud.lambiotte/) and also my industrial collaborators from [Tesco Data Science Team](https://www.tesco.com/). I was also part of Cohort 5 in the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training for Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling (InFoMM)](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/industrially-focused-mathematical-modelling-epsrc-cdt/).
