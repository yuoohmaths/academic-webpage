I am a [ELBE postdoc fellow](https://www.csbdresden.de/join-us/as-a-postdoc/) at [Center for Systems Biology Dresden](https://www.csbdresden.de/) (CSBD),  [Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems](https://www.pks.mpg.de/) (MPI PKS) and [Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/) (MPI CBG). My research focuses on the interaction between structure and dynamics in network systems, specifically when the relationship between entities is necessarily characterised by a real or complex value, or a matrix. I also work on the downstream applications in biological and quantum systems, and machine learning. 

I received my PhD from the University of Oxford in Oct. 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Renaud Lambiotte](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/renaud.lambiotte/) and in collaboration with [Tesco Data Science Team](https://www.tesco.com/). Between 2022 and 2024, I was a research fellow at Nordita, funded by Wallenberg Initiative on Networks and Quantum information (PIs: Prof. Frank Wilczek at [Nordita](https://www.nordita.org/people/staff/index.php?u=frank.wilczek) and [MIT](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/frank-wilczek/) and Prof. John Wettlaufer at [Nordita](https://www.nordita.org/people/staff/index.php?u=john.wettlaufer) and [Yale](https://physics.yale.edu/people/john-wettlaufer)).
